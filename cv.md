One year ago I’ve become passionate about development.

I have learned how to learn development by communicate with other people around development.
For nowadays I work as a junior Software Engineer part time at alem school and studying here. 
By part time I have extra free time, which I spend for learning Frontend Development.

I’m very interested in full stack development cause it is provides endless possibilities for professional growth,besides there’s alem school and rs school which give me for free high quality resources to self-education and with large community of developers.
